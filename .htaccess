# GitHub Pages doesn't use .htaccess, but keeping for reference
# The issue is that GitHub Pages serves static files without query parameter support

# For GitHub Pages with Next.js static export:
# 1. All files must be pure HTML/CSS/JS (no query param routing)
# 2. RSC .txt files are not compatible with GitHub Pages
# 3. Solution: Disable RSC streaming via next.config.mjs
