## Technical Highlights

```python
# Example: Moiré pattern detection using FFT
def detect_moire_pattern(image):
    # Convert to grayscale and apply FFT
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    f_transform = np.fft.fft2(gray)
    f_shift = np.fft.fftshift(f_transform)

    # Analyze frequency spectrum for periodic patterns
    magnitude_spectrum = np.abs(f_shift)

    # Detect anomalous peaks indicating screen capture
    return analyze_frequency_peaks(magnitude_spectrum)
```

## Impact

- **Revenue Protection**: Mitigated losses from fraudulent billing
