## Objective

To develop an advanced deep learning model for predicting diabetes risk, enhancing early detection and personalized healthcare interventions.

## The Solution

I implemented a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** architecture with **Xavier Initialization** and **Adam optimization** to ensure stable gradient flow and adaptive learning rates. The model was trained on a dataset of **20,000+ health records**, analyzing critical features such as Age, BMI, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol Levels.

I designed a **4-layer MLP** with 15, 32, and 16 neurons in the hidden layers and optimized the configuration by exploring various activation functions and error metrics. This tailored approach allowed the model to adapt effectively to the dynamic nature of healthcare data.

## Impact

The model outperformed traditional machine learning approaches, achieving:

- **Accuracy**: **90.79%**
- **Precision**: **91%**
- **Recall**: **88%**
- **F1-Score**: **90%**

This high level of accuracy sets a new benchmark for predictive modeling in diabetes detection, supporting more reliable diagnoses and personalized healthcare strategies.

## Key Skills

Deep Learning, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Xavier Initialization, Adam Optimization, Data Analysis, Precision-Recall Evaluation.

**Drexel University College of Computing & Informatics**

## Overview

Developed an advanced ML system for early diabetes detection, utilizing multiple classifiers for optimal performance, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes.

## Methodology

- **Model Selection**: Evaluated multiple classifiers and achieved an 82.26% accuracy rate with the Random Forest classifier, the top-performing model.
- **Data Balancing**: Balanced a dataset of 20,000+ rows using SMOTE for oversampling the minority class and random under-sampling for the majority class, ensuring fair model evaluation.
- **Preprocessing**: Preprocessed data by cleaning and normalizing datasets, applying advanced sampling techniques, and preparing it for robust analysis.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluated models comprehensively using metrics like precision (83.47%), recall (80.45%), F1-score (82.26%), ROC-AUC, and precision-recall curves.

## Key Achievements

- **Superior Performance**: Demonstrated superior model performance with Random Forest, leveraging its ensemble learning capabilities.
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Enhanced classification accuracy through data balancing techniques, improving sensitivity and specificity.
- **Healthcare Impact**: Contributed to early diabetes detection, providing a framework for scalable healthcare applications.

## Future Directions

- Incorporate temporal analysis to adapt to evolving healthcare trends.
- Explore advanced ensemble methods for further accuracy improvements.
