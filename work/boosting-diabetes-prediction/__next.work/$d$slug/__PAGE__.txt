## Objective

To develop an advanced deep learning model for predicting diabetes risk, enhancing early detection and personalized healthcare interventions.

## The Solution

I implemented a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** architecture with **Xavier Initialization** and **Adam optimization** to ensure stable gradient flow and adaptive learning rates. The model was trained on a dataset of **20,000+ health records**, analyzing critical features such as Age, BMI, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol Levels.

I designed a **4-layer MLP** with 15, 32, and 16 neurons in the hidden layers and optimized the configuration by exploring various activation functions and error metrics. This tailored approach allowed the model to adapt effectively to the dynamic nature of healthcare data.

## Impact

The model outperformed traditional machine learning approaches, achieving:

- **Accuracy**: **90.79%**
- **Precision**: **91%**
- **Recall**: **88%**
- **F1-Score**: **90%**

This high level of accuracy sets a new benchmark for predictive modeling in diabetes detection, supporting more reliable diagnoses and personalized healthcare strategies.

## Key Skills

Deep Learning, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Xavier Initialization, Adam Optimization, Data Analysis, Precision-Recall Evaluation.

## Role

**Lead and Data Scientist**

## Technologies

OpenCV, Django, Vue.js, PWA (Progressive Web Applications)

## The Challenge

Adani Electricity needed a robust solution to combat meter tampering and streamline their billing operations. The existing manual validation process was time-consuming and prone to human error, leading to revenue leakage and customer dissatisfaction.

## The Solution

I led the development of an AI-powered **Progressive Web Application (PWA)** using **Vue.js** and **Django**, designed to automate the meter reading and validation process. The core of the system is a sophisticated **computer vision model** leveraging **OpenCV**, which I engineered to detect **moiré patterns**—a subtle visual artifact often present in recaptured or tampered images.

To ensure the highest level of accuracy, I implemented a **frequency-based decomposition pipeline** that analyzes the image structure for inconsistencies. The model was rigorously tested and validated using over **50 distinct checks**, including object detection and boundary frame analysis, achieving a **91% accuracy rate** in identifying fraudulent submissions.

## Impact

The deployment of this system marked a significant step in Adani's digital transformation. By automating the validation process, we **streamlined billing operations**, significantly reducing the need for manual intervention and accelerating the billing cycle. This directly improved **revenue integrity** by mitigating losses from fraudulent activities. Furthermore, the user-friendly PWA provided a seamless experience for customers, boosting overall satisfaction and trust in the utility service.
